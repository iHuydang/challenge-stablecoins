You are a highly disciplined AI developer. Your task is to program a custom stablecoin called "VNĐ₮" based on the scaffold-eth "challenge-stablecoins" project that is already uploaded in the workspace at C:\Users\ADMIN\challenge-stablecoins. Follow these strict requirements:

1. **Stablecoin specifications**
   - Name: "VNĐ₮"
   - Symbol: "VNĐ₮"
   - Decimals: 18
   - Peg logic: 1000 VND real-world = 10,000 VNĐ₮ tokens (so 1 VNĐ₮ = 0.1 VND).
   - ERC20 standard with mint and burn functions controlled only by engine contract.

2. **Contracts structure**
   - `VNĐ₮oken.sol` (ERC20 token, mint/burn only by engine)
   - `VNĐEngine.sol` (core engine, manages collateral, minting, burning, liquidation)
     - Collateral: ETH
     - Collateral ratio: 150%
     - Mint: calculates VNĐ₮ according to collateral deposited × multiplier (1000 VND → 10,000 VNĐ₮)
     - Burn: user burns VNĐ₮ to retrieve ETH collateral
     - Handle liquidation if collateral value falls below collateral ratio
   - `DEX.sol` (ETH ↔ VNĐ₮ swap, simple AMM)
   - `VNĐStaking.sol` (optional: allow staking VNĐ₮ for interest)
   - `Oracle.sol` (fixed ETH/VND price, for simplicity)
   - `RateController.sol` (manages interest rates for minting/burning to maintain peg)

3. **Functional requirements**
   - Deployable on Ethereum testnet
   - Unit tests for:
     - Minting VNĐ₮ with correct collateral
     - Burning VNĐ₮ and returning collateral
     - Liquidation scenarios
     - Swap ETH ↔ VNĐ₮ on DEX
   - Use scaffold-eth scripts as a base for deployment
   - Use proper SafeMath and ReentrancyGuard patterns
   - Clear logging and events for mint, burn, liquidation, swap

4. **Coding standards**
   - Modular contracts, each in `packages/hardhat/contracts/`
   - Comment all functions clearly
   - Strictly follow ERC20, OpenZeppelin best practices
   - Do not hardcode any values except multiplier and collateral ratio
   - All scripts and contracts must run successfully on Hardhat testnet (yarn chain + yarn deploy)

5. **Output instructions**
   - Generate a complete project ready to deploy
   - Include:
     - Smart contracts (.sol)
     - Deployment scripts (deploy.js)
     - Tests (test/*.js)
     - Configured Hardhat/Scaffold-eth environment
   - Ensure that `yarn chain` and `yarn deploy` succeed without errors
   - Do not break existing scaffold-eth structure

6. **Additional constraints**
   - The AI should not modify other unrelated challenge files
   - Ensure all token calculations respect the 1000 VND = 10,000 VNĐ₮ ratio
   - Ensure the system is safe from undercollateralization

**Instruction to AI Agent:**  
Use the uploaded folder at C:\Users\ADMIN\challenge-stablecoins as your working directory. Build the VNĐ₮ stablecoin system exactly as specified. Produce all necessary contracts, deployment scripts, and tests. Confirm that the system compiles and runs successfully on Hardhat testnet.
